\description{
This dataset represents a clonal eucalyptus trial. It contains the mean annual increment (\code{mai}) of 100
eucalyptus clones. The trial was laid out
in randomized complete blocks design, with 21 replicates and one tree per plot.
This trial did not have contigous blocks: blocks 1-7 were in area 1, blocks 8-14 were in
area 2, and blocks 15-21 were in area 3. The \code{area} columns contains this information.
The dataset also has information about the position of each tree in the grid (\code{row} and \code{col}).
In the row and column directions, the plants are spaced
2 m (dist_row) and 3 m (dist_col) apart, respectively. Data were collected at 3 and 6 years after
the trial implementation (information contained in the column \code{age}).
