	abstract = {An individual’s genes may influence the phenotype of neighboring conspecifics. Such indirect genetic effects (IGEs) are important as they can affect the apparent total heritable variance in a population, and thus the response to selection. We studied these effects in a large, pedigreed population of Eucalyptus globulus using variance component analyses of Mycosphearella leaf disease, diameter growth at age 2 years, and post-infection diameter growth at ages 4 and 8 years. In a novel approach, we initially modeled IGEs using a factor analytic (FA) structure to identify the most influential neighbor positions, with the FA loadings being position-specific regressions on the IGEs. This involved sequentially comparing FA models for the variance–covariance matrices of the direct and indirect effects of each neighbor. We then modeled IGEs as a distance-based, combined effect of the most influential neighbors. This often increased the magnitude and significance of indirect genetic variance estimates relative to using all neighbors. The extension of a univariate IGEs model to bivariate analyses also provided insights into the genetic architecture of this population, revealing that: (1) IGEs arising from increased probability of neighbor infection were not associated with reduced growth of neighbors, despite adverse fitness effects being evident at the direct genetic level; and (2) the strong, genetic-based competitive interactions for growth, established early in stand development, were highly positively correlated over time. Our results highlight the complexities of genetic-based interactions at the multi-trait level due to (co)variances associated with IGEs, and the marked discrepancy occurring between direct and total heritable variances.},

	abstract = {Competition among domesticated plants or animals can have a dramatic negative impact on yield of a stand or farm. The usual quantitative genetic model ignores these competitive interactions and could result in seriously incorrect breeding decisions and acerbate animal well-being. A general solution to this problem is given, for either forest tree breeding or penned animals, with mixed-model methodology (BLUP) utilized to separate effects on the phenotype due to the individuals' own genes (direct effects) and those from competing individuals (associative effects) and thereby to allow an optimum index selection on those effects. Biological verification was based on two lines of Japanese quail selected for 6-week weight; one line was selected only for direct effects (D-BLUP) while the other was selected on an optimal index for both direct and associative effects (C-BLUP). Results over 23 cycles of selection showed that C-BLUP produced a significant positive response to selection (b = 0.52 ± 0.25 g/hatch) whereas D-BLUP resulted in a nonsignificant negative response (b = −0.10 ± 0.25 g/hatch). The regression of percentage of mortality on hatch number was significantly different between methods, decreasing with C-BLUP (b = −0.06 ± 0.15 deaths/hatch) and increasing with D-BLUP (b = 0.32 ± 0.15 deaths/hatch). These results demonstrate that the traditional D-BLUP approach without associative effects not only is detrimental to response to selection but also compromises the well-being of animals. The differences in response show that competitive effects can be included in breeding programs, without measuring new traits, so that costs of the breeding program need not increase.},

	abstract = {Indirect genetic effects (IGE) occur when the genotype of an individual affects the phenotypic trait value of another conspecific individual. IGEs can have profound effects on both the magnitude and the direction of response to selection. Models of inheritance and response to selection in traits subject to IGEs have been developed within two frameworks; a trait-based framework in which IGEs are specified as a direct consequence of individual trait values, and a variance-component framework in which phenotypic variance is decomposed into a direct and an indirect additive genetic component. This work is a selective review of the quantitative genetics of traits affected by IGEs, with a focus on modelling, estimation and interpretation issues. It includes a discussion on variance-component vs trait-based models of IGEs, a review of issues related to the estimation of IGEs from field data, including the estimation of the interaction coefficient Ψ (psi), and a discussion on the relevance of IGEs for response to selection in cases where the strength of interaction varies among pairs of individuals. An investigation of the trait-based model shows that the interaction coefficient Ψ may deviate considerably from the corresponding regression coefficient when feedback occurs. The increasing research effort devoted to IGEs suggests that they are a widespread phenomenon, probably particularly in natural populations and plants. Further work in this field should considerably broaden our understanding of the quantitative genetics of inheritance and response to selection in relation to the social organisation of populations.},

              An individual tree model with additive direct and competition effects is introduced to account for competitive effects in forest genetics evaluation. The mixed linear model includes fixed effects as well as direct and competition breeding values plus permanent environmental effects. Competition effects, either additive or environmental, are identified in the phenotype of a competitor tree by means of ‘intensity of competition’ elements (IC), which are non-zero elements of the incidence matrix of the additive competition effects. The ICs are inverse function of the distance and the number of competing individuals, either row-column wise or diagonally. The ICs allow standardization of the variance of competition effects in the phenotypic variance of any individual tree, so that the model accounts for unequal number of neighbors. Expressions are obtained for the bias in estimating additive variance using the covariance between half-sibs, when ignoring competition effects for row-plot designs and for single-tree plot designs. A data set of loblolly pines on growth at breast height is used to estimate the additive variances of direct and competition effects, the covariance between both effects, and the variance of permanent environmental effects using a Bayesian method via Gibbs sampling and Restricted Maximum Likelihood procedures (REML) via the Expectation- Maximization (EM) algorithm. No problem of convergence was detected with the model and ICs used when compared to what has been reported in the animal breeding literature for such models.

	doi = {10.1016/j.foreco.2023.121393},
	abstract = {Biotic and abiotic stresses have been making it difficult to maintain the rates of genetic gains in forest tree breeding. Planting a mixture of genotypes or clonal composites can be an alternative to increase the security of forest plantations. The formation of clonal composites is complex due to inter-genotypic competition and indirect genotypic effects that can affect the efficiency of genetic selection. This study aims to understand how indirect genotypic effects can impact the response to selection and how the stand composition can be used to explore these effects and enhance forest yield. We used two clonal trials of eucalyptus hybrids implanted in a randomized complete block design with 24 replications, containing a single tree per plot evaluated for mean annual increment at 3 and 6 years. We focused on partitioning the genotypic variation into direct and indirect genotypic effects based on competition intensity factors. We identified aggressive, homeostatic, and sensitive clones based on the magnitude of indirect genotypic effects. Considering indirect genotypic effects, for mean annual increment, the total heritability decreased from 0.25 to 0.10 for 3 years and from 0.30 to 0.14 for 6 years, respectively. We proposed a workflow that uses the direct and indirect genotypic effects to predict the mean values for clonal composite combinations and to select the one with the highest yield. Our methodology considered spatial variation and interplot competition that can affect the total heritable estimates and response to selection in forest trials. The clones were classified as aggressive, homeostatic, and sensitive, according to their deviation from the indirect genotypic effects means. Our methodology enabled the extraction of useful information and predict many clonal composites' performance, which can be used in recommending genotypes to be planted in mixtures.},
